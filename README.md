# NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization   Understand the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers  Train a Naive Bayes Classifier and assess its performance

In this hands-on project, I train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.
